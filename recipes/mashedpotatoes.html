        <h5>shitty mashed potatoes yummy!</h5>
        <p>I don't think I want to make mashed potatoes in any other way after tasting these. The dill is not overpowering at all. I might not salt the potato water next time as they were a bit saltier than I prefer. I might also add black pepper and cut back a bit on the bullion.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 medium white potatoes, peeled </li>

            <li>2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
