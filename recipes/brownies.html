        <h5>These brownies are not yummy!</h5>
        <p>I've never made brownies with melted chocolate chips before so I was very curious, however, with so many reviewers pleased with this recipe I felt confident I wouldn't be disappointed - and I wasn't. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. As the submitter warns, don't overbake and you'll be rewarded with rich, fudgy brownies. Great as is, but I topped mine with Brownie Frosting, recipe also from this site.</p>
